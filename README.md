Real-world AWS labs, study notes, and cloud skills built in public as part of my 2025 journey.

# 🌩️ Jayjay's AWS Journey

Welcome to my **AWS learning log**! This repo documents my hands-on experiences, challenges, lessons, and fixes as I work through AWS Fundamentals and beyond.

## ✨ Why This Exists

Instead of following tutorials blindly, I'm building this repo to:
- Track what I've done and why
- Document mistakes I made (and how I fixed them)
- Show real-world AWS growth, not just perfect projects
- Reflect my thought process while learning cloud engineering

## ✅ What I’ve Done So Far

- Set up multiple IAM accounts from the root
- Applied permission policies and enabled MFA
- Learned the consequences of Free Tier account eligibility issues

## 🔮 Next Up

- Create IAM groups and roles  
- Begin working with S3 and CLI  
- Track permission errors and debug them with real examples
